**comments begining with TODO have to be connected with the server

index.php is a page where anyone can see all public events. Log in button allows users to log in

login.php allows users to log in as an organizer/individual, and see their pages

pages begining with u are for individual users

pages in /organizer are for organizers

/theme is empty for now--we could add more to it if we have time

NEXT: scrape events from Facebook, import Google Calendar -- (I'll try to make scripts that work locally first before moving them to the server)
